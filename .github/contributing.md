## Guide to the main directories/files

First, let's talk about the top-level directories:

```sh
book # Contains materials related to the online book

packages # Contains the latest source code of chibivue. Not directly related to the online book.

examples # Contains sample code using the packages. Not directly related to the online book.

tools # Development and reader tools for the online book.

.github # Contains CI configuration files and contribution guides.
```

Now, let's take a closer look at the book directory.

```sh
book
  |- images # Contains image files used in the online book.
  |- online-book # The main body of the online book. It is a Vitepress project.
  |- impls # Contains the source code for each chapter.
```

## Guide about the method of contribution

### Before submitting a pull request

### Forking the repository

Access https://github.com/Ubugeeei/chibivue and click on the `Fork` button on this page to fork it to your own account.

You can choose any name for the repository. Feel free to set other information as well.

### Setting up the local environment

#### Installing the necessary tools

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18.x)
  We use [Volta](https://volta.sh/) for version management, so please install it if you haven't already.
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v8.x)
- [@antfu/ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni)
  ni is a great package manager wrapper created by [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu). We assume the use of ni in the chibivue documentation.

### Starting the playground

First, install the dependencies.

```sh
ni
```

Then, run the following command to start the development server for the online book.

```sh
nr book:dev
```

If you want to run the source code for each chapter, you can do so with the following command.

```sh
cd book/impls/${section-name}/${chapter-name}
nr dev
```

#### Creating a branch (start making changes)

Clone the forked repository and create a branch.

Before creating a branch, make sure the upstream is set to the main branch.

As for the branch name, if it is related to a specific issue, please use the format `${issue-number}-${description (kebab-case)}`.  
Please make the description as clear and unique as possible.
There are no strict rules at the moment, but please avoid very short names or names that are too generic (lack uniqueness).  
If it is not related to a specific issue, the issue number is not necessary.

It would be helpful if you could create an issue whenever possible. It is not necessary for simple typo fixes.  
Also, if the changes are expected to be significant or critical in content, it would be appreciated if you could consult with @Ubugeeei in advance.  
(If such changes are made without consultation, there is a possibility that the PR will be rejected depending on the case.)

### Creating commits

There are no strict rules regarding the content and granularity of commit messages to the working branch.

For commit messages, we have provided a configuration file for git-cz (changelog.config.cjs), so it is recommended to use it (but not required).

If you want to use git-cz, you need to install it locally.

```sh
npm install -g git-cz
```

```sh
# When you run the cz command with the staged changes, an interactive shell will start.
git cz
```

Of course, if you have any suggestions for the git-cz configuration file, please feel free to send a PR.

Regarding commit messages, if the issue number is included in the branch name, the issue number will be automatically included in the commit message.  
This is achieved by husky, and you can check the details in `/.husky/commit-msg`.

### Creating a Pull Request

Once you have finished making changes locally and pushed the changes, please create a Pull Request to the main branch of https://github.com/Ubugeeei/chibivue.  
Please make the title and description of the Pull Request as clear as possible.  
Please always notify @Ubugeeei when the work is completed to keep track of whether the work is in progress or completed.  
You can mention @Ubugeeei in the PR comment. The same applies when the changes are completed after the review.
Also, please make sure to check that the CI has succeeded before reporting completion.

Basically, all PRs are managed by @Ubugeeei, so please contact @Ubugeeei for any inquiries.

## Guide about the contents of contribution

This is a guide to the changes you make. Here are a few points to keep in mind.

- When making changes to the online book, please make sure that the content is consistent in both the Japanese and English versions.
- When making changes to the source code of each chapter, please appropriately incorporate those changes into the source code of subsequent chapters.
- When including images, figures, or text from other sources, please make sure to provide proper attribution.
